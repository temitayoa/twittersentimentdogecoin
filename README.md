# twittersentimentdogecoin
This project aims to answer or add clarity to the question, "Can we predict the price movement of Dogecoin based upon tweets?"

Dogecoin price data was acquired from January 2021 - May 2021 for this project. 

Here is a link of me presenting the first iteration of this project in May 2021.

Inside the project at the end of the code are areas for improvement and business use cases. 

Thank you for viewing my project and please feel free to reach out for networking or brainstorming new ideas.
